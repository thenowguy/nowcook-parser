# Mac & Cheese - Perfection Testing Guide

## Goal
Create the **perfect** reference meal that demonstrates NowCook's value with zero errors. This will be the template for refining the other 4 Alpha meals.

## Current State

**Mac & Cheese v1.0**
- **10 tasks** from water boiling to final seasoning
- **Total time:** ~26 minutes (8+8+2+2+2+5+2+1+2+1)
- **Parallelism:** Sauce starts (t3) as soon as pasta starts boiling (t2 SS dependency)

### Task Breakdown:
1. Bring water to boil - 8min (unattended)
2. Boil macaroni - 8min (unattended) 
3. Melt butter - 2min (attended) ‚Üê starts when pasta starts
4. Whisk in flour (roux) - 2min (attended)
5. Whisk in milk - 2min (attended)
6. Simmer sauce - 5min (unattended)
7. Stir in cheese - 2min (attended)
8. Drain pasta - 1min (attended)
9. Combine pasta + sauce - 2min (attended)
10. Season - 1min (attended)

## Testing Protocol

### Phase 1: Kitchen Reality Check
**Objective:** Cook the actual meal with a timer

1. **Setup:**
   - Print this guide
   - Have all ingredients ready
   - Timer/stopwatch ready
   - Notepad for observations

2. **Cook & Time:**
   - Start timer when you begin task #1
   - Note actual time for each task
   - Mark when you could have started another task (parallelism opportunities)
   - Note if you felt rushed or had too much idle time

3. **Record Issues:**
   - [ ] Task too short/long (by how much?)
   - [ ] Dependency wrong (could start earlier/later?)
   - [ ] Task too granular or too coarse?
   - [ ] Attended/unattended classification wrong?
   - [ ] Missing steps?

### Phase 2: App Editing
**Objective:** Use the new editor to fix issues

1. **Load Mac & Cheese** in http://localhost:5174
2. **Scroll to Meal Editor** section (orange box at bottom)
3. **Adjust based on Phase 1 notes:**
   - Change durations
   - Toggle attended/unattended checkboxes
   - Edit task names for clarity

4. **Test in Runtime:**
   - Click "Start run"
   - Watch the timeline
   - Verify tasks become available at right times
   - Check if driver busy/free makes sense

5. **Iterate:**
   - Reset and adjust
   - Test again
   - Repeat until perfect

### Phase 3: Save Perfect Version
1. **Click "Copy JSON"** button in editor
2. **Paste into** `/src/meals/mac_and_cheese.json`
3. **Commit** with detailed notes on what you changed and why

## Questions to Answer

### Timing
- [ ] Is 8 min realistic for water to boil? (depends on pot size, burner power)
- [ ] Is 8 min enough for elbow macaroni? (box usually says 7-8 min)
- [ ] Is 2 min enough to melt butter AND have pan ready? (or too much?)
- [ ] Roux: 2 min to whisk flour into butter until smooth?
- [ ] Milk addition: 2 min to gradually add and whisk?
- [ ] Simmer: Does 5 min actually thicken the sauce enough?

### Dependencies
- [ ] Should sauce start (t3) when pasta *starts* (SS) or after some time?
- [ ] Is there prep we could do *before* water boils? (measure ingredients, grate cheese?)

### Task Granularity
- [ ] Should "Whisk in flour" and "Whisk in milk" be one combined task?
- [ ] Should there be a "Get out ingredients" task at start?
- [ ] Is "Season" too vague? (Should it specify salt, pepper, paprika separately?)

### Attended/Unattended
- [ ] Is "Simmer sauce" truly unattended? (Do you need to stir occasionally?)
- [ ] Is "Boil macaroni" truly unattended? (Do you check for doneness?)

### Missing Steps
- [ ] Clean pot before starting?
- [ ] Grate cheese beforehand?
- [ ] Reserve pasta water? (for adjusting sauce consistency)
- [ ] Let rest before serving?

## Success Criteria

The meal is "perfect" when:
1. ‚úÖ Every duration matches kitchen reality (¬±30 sec acceptable)
2. ‚úÖ You can follow the MealMap without confusion
3. ‚úÖ Parallelism actually saves time without creating chaos
4. ‚úÖ No moments where you're waiting with nothing to do
5. ‚úÖ No moments where you feel rushed or overwhelmed
6. ‚úÖ Dependencies make logical sense
7. ‚úÖ Someone unfamiliar with the recipe could follow it successfully

## Learnings to Extract

Once Mac & Cheese is perfect, document:
- **Timing patterns:** Are our estimates generally too optimistic/pessimistic?
- **Dependency patterns:** When should we use SS vs FS?
- **Task patterns:** What level of granularity works best?
- **Verb patterns:** Which verbs are truly unattended? Which need attention?

These patterns will guide refinement of the other 4 Alpha meals.
