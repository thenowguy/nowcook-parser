# Universal Prior #3: Temporal Flexibility

## The Problem

Traditional cooking timers and recipe apps treat all tasks as rigid: "do this now, then do that." But kitchen reality is more flexible:

- **Thursday 4:26pm**: You could grate cheese for tomorrow's Mac & Cheese
- **Friday morning**: You could prep vegetables for dinner
- **Friday 7:00pm**: You must start water boiling to serve by 7:30pm

Current NowCook implementation showed "Grate cheese" as "Blocked" when it should be available immediately. The app was corralling users to cook on its schedule, not theirs.

## The Solution: Four Task States

Every task exists in one of four states relative to the NowLine and your desired serve time:

### 1. **Could do now** ‚è∞
**Flexible prep tasks with no time urgency**

These can be done **anytime**: the night before, this morning, right now, or later during cooking. They sit at the NowLine waiting for you to choose when to execute.

**Examples:**
- "Grate cheddar cheese" - can prep Thursday for Friday dinner
- "Mince garlic" - could do now or while water boils
- "Cube chicken" - prep whenever convenient
- "Trim asparagus" - any time before cooking

**Characteristics:**
- Unattended (doesn't require driver)
- No time sensitivity (won't spoil if done early)
- Dependencies satisfied (if any)
- User decides when to execute

**Implementation:**
```javascript
// Could do now: unattended prep with no time urgency
if (!t.requires_driver && !hasTimeSensitivity(t)) {
  couldDoNow.push(t);
}
```

### 2. **Can do now** ‚úÖ
**Ready to execute when driver becomes available**

Dependencies are met, but these tasks follow the normal flow. Not time-critical, but follow dependency chain.

**Examples:**
- "Bring water to a boil" - ready when you are
- "Heat skillet over medium-high" - can start anytime
- "Measure flour" - ready to do
- "Preheat oven" - available now

**Characteristics:**
- May require driver
- Dependencies satisfied
- Ready to execute immediately
- Follows normal cooking flow

**Implementation:**
```javascript
// Can do now: ready when driver available
if (t.requires_driver && driverBusy) {
  cantDoYet.push(t);
} else {
  canDoNow.push(t);
}
```

### 3. **Can't do yet** ‚è∏Ô∏è
**Waiting on dependencies or too early**

These are blocked by unfinished predecessors or would spoil if done too early.

**Examples:**
- "Drain pasta" - water not boiling yet
- "Add pasta to boiling water" - waiting on boil
- "Stir in grated cheese" - cheese not grated yet, sauce not ready
- "Steam broccoli" - too early, would get cold before serving

**Characteristics:**
- Dependencies not yet satisfied
- OR driver is busy (for attended tasks)
- OR too early (would spoil/cool)
- Cannot be executed yet

**Implementation:**
```javascript
// Can't do yet: dependencies not satisfied
if (!depsOK) { 
  cantDoYet.push(t); 
}
```

### 4. **Must do now** üî•
**Critical path - time-sensitive actions**

These must be done immediately or within a tight window, or the meal will fail.

**Examples:**
- "Remove from oven" - will burn if delayed
- "Flip steak" - needs flipping now
- "Plate and serve" - food is ready, serve immediately
- "Steam broccoli" - must do close to serve time or gets cold

**Characteristics:**
- Time-sensitive verbs (steam, plate, serve, remove, flip)
- Critical to meal success
- Must execute in tight window
- No flexibility in timing

**Implementation:**
```javascript
function hasTimeSensitivity(task) {
  const timeSensitiveVerbs = ['steam', 'plate', 'serve', 'remove', 'flip', 'stir'];
  const verb = (task.canonical_verb || '').toLowerCase();
  return timeSensitiveVerbs.includes(verb);
}
```

## Kitchen Reality Example: Mac & Cheese

### Scenario
**Thursday 4:26pm**: User wants to serve Mac & Cheese **Friday 7:30pm**

**Traditional app behavior:**
- User opens app
- Must wait until ~7:00pm Friday to start
- App dictates: "eat at 7:28pm sharp"
- No flexibility, no choices

**NowCook behavior with temporal flexibility:**

**Thursday 4:26pm:**
```
Could do now:
  ‚è∞ Grate cheddar cheese (3 min, unattended)
  ‚è∞ Measure milk (1 min, unattended)

Can do now:
  ‚úÖ Bring large pot of salted water to a boil (10 min, unattended)

Can't do yet:
  ‚è∏Ô∏è Add pasta to boiling water
  ‚è∏Ô∏è Drain pasta
  ‚è∏Ô∏è Make cheese sauce
  ... (all downstream tasks)
```

**User choice: Grate cheese now?**
- ‚úÖ Yes ‚Üí Completes prep early, less work tomorrow
- ‚èπÔ∏è No ‚Üí Leave it for tomorrow, more flexibility

**Friday 7:05pm (25 minutes before serve):**
```
Could do now:
  ‚è∞ Grate cheddar cheese (3 min) [if not done Thursday]

Can do now:
  ‚úÖ Bring large pot of salted water to a boil (10 min)
  ‚úÖ Make cheese sauce (5 min)

You'll be serving at: 7:30pm ‚úì
```

## The GPS Metaphor

Just like GPS navigation:
- **"You could leave by 6:15pm"** ‚Üí You have flexibility, leave anytime before 6:45pm
- **"You must leave by 6:45pm"** ‚Üí Critical path, no more buffer time
- **"Leave now"** ‚Üí Must execute immediately to hit destination

NowCook provides the same guidance:
- **"Could do now"** ‚Üí Flexible prep, do anytime
- **"Can do now"** ‚Üí Ready when you are
- **"Must do now"** ‚Üí Critical path, execute immediately

## Implementation Details

### Task Classification Logic

```javascript
for (const t of tasks) {
  if (doneIds.has(t.id) || runningIds.has(t.id)) continue;
  
  const depsOK = depsSatisfied(t, ...);
  
  // Can't do yet: dependencies not satisfied
  if (!depsOK) { 
    cantDoYet.push(t); 
    continue; 
  }
  
  // Dependencies satisfied - classify by temporal flexibility
  
  // Could do now: unattended prep with no time urgency
  if (!t.requires_driver && !hasTimeSensitivity(t)) {
    couldDoNow.push(t);
    continue;
  }
  
  // Can do now: ready when driver available
  if (t.requires_driver && driverBusy) {
    cantDoYet.push(t);
  } else {
    canDoNow.push(t);
  }
}
```

### Time-Sensitive Verb Detection

```javascript
function hasTimeSensitivity(task) {
  // Tasks that must be done close to serve time
  const timeSensitiveVerbs = [
    'steam',   // vegetables get cold
    'plate',   // food is ready now
    'serve',   // immediate action
    'remove',  // will burn/overcook
    'flip',    // timing critical
    'stir'     // ongoing attention needed
  ];
  
  const verb = (task.canonical_verb || '').toLowerCase();
  return timeSensitiveVerbs.includes(verb);
}
```

### Serve Time Prediction

```javascript
// Calculate when you'll be serving
const remainingTasks = state.meal.tasks.filter(t => 
  !rt.doneIds.has(t.id) && 
  !rt.running.find(r => r.id === t.id)
);

const remainingMinutes = remainingTasks.reduce((sum, t) => 
  sum + getPlannedMinutes(t), 0
);

const runningMinutes = rt.running.reduce((sum, r) => 
  sum + Math.ceil((r.endsAt - rt.nowMs) / 60000), 0
);

const totalMinutes = remainingMinutes + runningMinutes;
const serveTime = new Date(Date.now() + totalMinutes * 60000);
```

## UI Design

### Visual Hierarchy

**Could do now** (Blue background, ‚è∞ icon):
- Most flexible, optional
- Blue conveys calm, no urgency
- "Do now, later, or even the night before"

**Can do now** (Standard, ‚úÖ icon):
- Normal flow, ready to execute
- Green checkmark: dependencies met
- "Dependencies met ‚Äî ready when you are"

**Can't do yet** (Standard, ‚è∏Ô∏è icon):
- Blocked, waiting
- Pause icon: must wait
- "Waiting on dependencies or too early to start"

**Must do now** (Red/urgent, üî• icon):
- Critical path, immediate action
- Red conveys urgency
- "Critical path ‚Äî will miss serve time if not done now"
- *(Future: when serve time mode implemented)*

### Serve Time Banner

Prominent purple gradient banner showing:
- üïê "You'll be serving at 7:30pm"
- "Estimated time remaining: 28 minutes"

Updates dynamically as tasks complete.

## Why This Matters for Alpha

Without temporal flexibility, NowCook becomes a dictatorial timer:
- "You must eat at 6:47pm"
- No prep flexibility
- Can't plan ahead
- Defeats GPS-like guidance value prop

With temporal flexibility:
- ‚úÖ "Could grate cheese now or later" - user's choice
- ‚úÖ "You'll be serving at 7:30pm" - prediction, not dictation
- ‚úÖ Prep ahead when convenient
- ‚úÖ True GPS-like flexibility

**This is foundational for Alpha**: without it, testers will reject the rigid scheduling and miss NowCook's core value proposition.

## Future: Full Serve Time Mode (Beta)

### Option A: Calendar Picker + Backward Planning

**User sets serve time:**
- "I want to serve Friday at 7:30pm"
- App calculates backward from serve time
- Shows all "Could do now" tasks available anytime before
- Shows "Must start by" time for critical path

**Example:**
```
Serve time: Friday 7:30pm

Could do now (available anytime before 7:30pm):
  ‚è∞ Grate cheddar cheese (3 min)
  ‚è∞ Measure milk (1 min)

Must start by 7:05pm:
  üî• Bring water to boil (10 min)
  üî• Cook pasta (8 min)
  üî• Make sauce (5 min)
```

**Implementation complexity:**
- Calendar/time picker UI
- Backward critical path calculation
- "Must start by" warnings
- Time zone handling

**Scope:** Beta (full feature)

## Relationship to Other Universal Priors

### Universal Prior #1: Nothing Takes No Time
- Every task has realistic duration (minimum 1 minute)
- Includes all hidden work: finding ingredients, walking, setup, cleanup
- Affects serve time calculation accuracy

### Universal Prior #2: Emergent Ingredients
- Transformation tasks (grate, mince, dice) are explicit
- These transformations are perfect "Could do now" candidates
- Example: "Grate cheese" is emergent ingredient creation
- Can be done anytime before consumption

### Universal Prior #3: Temporal Flexibility
- Tasks have different timing requirements
- Some are flexible (could do now), some are rigid (must do now)
- Enables realistic cooking flow
- Delivers GPS-like guidance instead of rigid timer

Together, these three priors create NowCook's foundation:
1. **Realistic timing** (nothing is instant)
2. **Visible work** (transformations are tasks)
3. **Flexible guidance** (cook on your schedule)

## Testing Checklist

### Mac & Cheese v2.0
- [ ] "Grate cheese" shows in "Could do now" at start
- [ ] Can execute "Grate cheese" immediately (0:00 runtime)
- [ ] Serve time prediction shows in purple banner
- [ ] "Can do now" shows ready tasks
- [ ] "Can't do yet" shows blocked tasks correctly
- [ ] Completing tasks updates serve time prediction

### Other Alpha Meals
- [ ] Identify "Could do now" tasks in each meal
- [ ] Verify time-sensitive tasks classified correctly
- [ ] Test serve time prediction accuracy
- [ ] Validate user can prep ahead when desired

### Edge Cases
- [ ] All "Could do now" completed early - still shows correct serve time
- [ ] No "Could do now" tasks - still functions normally
- [ ] Time-sensitive task (steam) triggers urgency appropriately
- [ ] Driver busy with attended "Could do now" task - blocked correctly

## Success Criteria

‚úÖ Alpha testers can prep ahead when convenient  
‚úÖ App provides guidance, not dictation  
‚úÖ "You'll be serving at X" prediction is accurate  
‚úÖ Users understand four task states intuitively  
‚úÖ No confusion about what's available vs blocked  
‚úÖ GPS metaphor is clear in practice  

## Commit Message Template

```
Feature: Implement temporal flexibility (Universal Prior #3)

Four task states relative to NowLine and serve time:
- Could do now: flexible prep, do anytime (grate cheese)
- Can do now: ready when you are (boil water)
- Can't do yet: waiting on dependencies (drain pasta)
- Must do now: time-critical actions (remove from oven)

Adds serve time prediction: "You'll be serving at X"
Enables prep-ahead flexibility without rigid scheduling

This is foundational for Alpha: without temporal flexibility,
NowCook becomes a dictatorial timer instead of GPS-like guide.
```
