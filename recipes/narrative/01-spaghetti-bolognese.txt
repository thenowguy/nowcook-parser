Spaghetti Bolognese

Ingredients:
- 1 1/2 tbsp olive oil
- 2 garlic cloves, minced
- 1 onion, finely chopped
- 1 lb / 500g beef mince (ground beef)
- 1/2 cup (125 ml) dry red wine
- 2 beef bouillon cubes
- 800g / 28 oz can crushed tomato
- 2 tbsp tomato paste
- 2 tsp white sugar (if needed)
- 2 tsp Worcestershire sauce
- 2 dried bay leaves
- 2 sprigs fresh thyme
- 3/4 tsp cooking salt
- 1/2 tsp black pepper
- 400 g / 13 oz spaghetti
- Parmesan cheese and parsley (optional)

Instructions:

Begin by heating oil in a large pot over medium-high heat. Add the onion and garlic, cooking until they become light golden and softened, approximately three minutes.

Increase the heat to high and add the beef mince. Break it up as it cooks until it reaches a browned state. Pour in the red wine, bringing it to a simmer and cooking for one minute while scraping the pot's bottom until the alcohol aroma dissipates.

Combine the remaining ingredients into the pot. Stir everything together, bring to a simmer, then reduce heat to medium so the sauce bubbles gently. Cook uncovered for twenty to thirty minutes, stirring occasionally and adding water if the sauce becomes too thick.

For enhanced flavor, cover with a lid and simmer on very low heat for two to two and a half hours, stirring every thirty minutes. Then uncover and simmer for an additional twenty minutes to thicken.

Taste and adjust salt as desired. Serve over cooked spaghetti, optionally tossing the sauce and pasta together.
