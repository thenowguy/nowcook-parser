Sheet Pan Salmon with Vegetables

Ingredients:
- 1 teaspoon paprika
- 1 teaspoon baharat
- Kosher salt
- Freshly ground black pepper
- 1 head cauliflower
- 3 carrots (peeled)
- 3 garlic cloves (minced)
- 3 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil (divided)
- 4 skinless salmon fillets (4-5 ounces each)
- 8 Castelvetrano olives (pitted and slivered)
- 1 lemon (halved)
- 1/3 cup chopped cilantro

Instructions:

Prepare. Heat your oven to 450°F.

Make the spice blend. Combine paprika, baharat, 1¼ teaspoon salt, and generous pepper in a small bowl.

Ready the vegetables. Remove cauliflower leaves and core, then cut florets into bite-sized pieces (about 6 cups total). Slice carrots lengthwise if needed, then cut diagonally into ½-inch pieces. Toss vegetables with garlic, 2 tablespoons oil, and ¾ of the spice mixture in a large bowl. Spread on a rimmed baking sheet in a single layer.

Roast vegetables. Bake about 15 minutes until cauliflower starts to brown.

Prepare fish. While vegetables roast, brush salmon fillets with remaining oil and sprinkle with remaining spice mixture.

Combine and finish roasting. Remove the pan from the oven. Toss in olives with vegetables, move them to pan sides, and place salmon in the center. Bake 5-8 minutes until fish is opaque but still moist.

Serve. Squeeze half the lemon over everything. Divide among plates, garnish with cilantro, and serve with remaining lemon wedges.
