Ingredients:
- 1 clove garlic
- 4cm piece ginger
- 1 fresh red chilli
- 2 carrots
- 1/2 red onion
- 1 red pepper
- 80g purple sprouting or tenderstem broccoli
- 80g mixed mushrooms
- 1 free-range chicken breast
- 1 teaspoon Chinese five-spice
- 1 tablespoon sesame oil
- 1 teaspoon vegetable oil
- 130g baby corn
- 80g mangetout or sugar snap peas
- 2 wholewheat noodle nests (130g)
- 1 tablespoon reduced-salt soy sauce
- 1 tablespoon black bean sauce
- 1 teaspoon sesame seeds
- Optional: fresh coriander sprigs

Method:

Begin by preparing your aromatics and vegetables. Peel and finely chop the garlic and ginger, then deseed and finely chop the chilli. Peel the carrots, halve lengthways, and slice finely. Peel the onion and deseed the pepper, slicing both thinly. Trim the broccoli, halving any thick stalks lengthways. Wipe the mushrooms clean, trim their stalks, and halve any larger pieces.

Cut the chicken into 1cm strips and coat them with the Chinese five-spice and sesame oil. Heat a wok or large non-stick frying pan on medium-high heat with vegetable oil. Add the garlic, ginger, and chilli, tossing for 30 seconds before adding the chicken. Stir-fry for 1-2 minutes until golden. Add all vegetables and continue stir-frying for 3-4 minutes until the chicken is cooked through and vegetables are tender yet retain some crunch.

While cooking, boil the noodles in salted water according to packet instructions. Transfer the noodles directly into the wok using tongs, then add soy and black bean sauce, tossing everything to coat. Divide between plates, scatter sesame seeds and coriander on top, and serve immediately.
