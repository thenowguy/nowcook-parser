Chocolate Chip Cookies

Ingredients:
- 2 cups all-purpose flour (spooned and leveled)
- 1 teaspoon baking soda
- 1 teaspoon sea salt
- 3/4 cup unsalted butter (1½ sticks, melted and cooled slightly)
- 1/2 cup packed brown sugar
- 1/2 cup granulated sugar
- 1 large egg
- 1 large egg yolk
- 2 teaspoons vanilla extract
- 1 heaping cup dark chocolate chips

Instructions:

In a medium bowl, whisk together the flour, baking soda, and salt.

Combine melted butter with both sugars in a large bowl. Add egg and yolk, whisking until well combined with no egg white streaks remaining. Mix in vanilla.

Fold dry ingredients into wet ingredients using a spatula. When mostly combined, add chocolate chips and mix until no dry flour remains.

Cover and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes and up to 2 days. Brief chilling (30 minutes) yields flatter, more spread-out cookies; longer chilling (2+ hours) produces thicker cookies.

Preheat oven to 350°F and line two baking sheets with parchment paper.

Use a 2-tablespoon cookie scoop to scoop the dough onto the baking sheets, leaving at least 2 inches between cookies. Bake one sheet at a time for 9-11 minutes until edges are golden but tops remain pale.

Let cool on baking sheets for 10 minutes before transferring to a wire rack.
