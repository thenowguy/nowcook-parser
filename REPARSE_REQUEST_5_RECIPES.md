This is a **RE-PARSE** of all 5 existing Sonnet recipes to add:

1. **Ingredient Quantities** - New `ingredients` array at meal level with quantities, units, and prep states
2. **Hold Window Data** - New `hold_window_minutes` and `temporal_flexibility` fields on every task

## Instructions

Please re-parse all 5 recipes below using the updated FOR_SONNET.md instructions (included at the end of this file). For each recipe:

1. Parse using standard FOR_SONNET.md rules
2. Add `ingredients` array with quantities (see section "NEW: Ingredient Quantities Extraction")
3. Add hold window metadata to every task (see section "NEW: Hold Window Data")

# Recipe 1: Spaghetti Bolognese

## Ingredients:
- 1 1/2 tbsp olive oil
- 2 garlic cloves, minced
- 1 onion, finely chopped
- 1 lb / 500g beef mince (ground beef)
- 1/2 cup (125 ml) dry red wine
- 2 beef bouillon cubes
- 800g / 28 oz can crushed tomato
- 2 tbsp tomato paste
- 2 tsp white sugar (if needed)
- 2 tsp Worcestershire sauce
- 2 dried bay leaves
- 2 sprigs fresh thyme
- 3/4 tsp cooking salt
- 1/2 tsp black pepper
- 400 g / 13 oz spaghetti
- Parmesan cheese and parsley (optional)

## Instructions:

Begin by heating oil in a large pot over medium-high heat. Add the onion and garlic, cooking until they become light golden and softened, approximately three minutes.

Increase the heat to high and add the beef mince. Break it up as it cooks until it reaches a browned state. Pour in the red wine, bringing it to a simmer and cooking for one minute while scraping the pot's bottom until the alcohol aroma dissipates.

Combine the remaining ingredients into the pot. Stir everything together, bring to a simmer, then reduce heat to medium so the sauce bubbles gently. Cook uncovered for twenty to thirty minutes, stirring occasionally and adding water if the sauce becomes too thick.

For enhanced flavor, cover with a lid and simmer on very low heat for two to two and a half hours, stirring every thirty minutes. Then uncover and simmer for an additional twenty minutes to thicken.

Taste and adjust salt as desired. Serve over cooked spaghetti, optionally tossing the sauce and pasta together.

# Recipe 2: Chicken & Veg Stir-Fry

## Ingredients:
- 1 clove garlic
- 4cm piece ginger
- 1 fresh red chilli
- 2 carrots
- 1/2 red onion
- 1 red pepper
- 80g purple sprouting or tenderstem broccoli
- 80g mixed mushrooms
- 1 free-range chicken breast
- 1 teaspoon Chinese five-spice
- 1 tablespoon sesame oil
- 1 teaspoon vegetable oil
- 130g baby corn
- 80g mangetout or sugar snap peas
- 2 wholewheat noodle nests (130g)
- 1 tablespoon reduced-salt soy sauce
- 1 tablespoon black bean sauce
- 1 teaspoon sesame seeds
- Optional: fresh coriander sprigs

## Method:

Begin by preparing your aromatics and vegetables. Peel and finely chop the garlic and ginger, then deseed and finely chop the chilli. Peel the carrots, halve lengthways, and slice finely. Peel the onion and deseed the pepper, slicing both thinly. Trim the broccoli, halving any thick stalks lengthways. Wipe the mushrooms clean, trim their stalks, and halve any larger pieces.

Cut the chicken into 1cm strips and coat them with the Chinese five-spice and sesame oil. Heat a wok or large non-stick frying pan on medium-high heat with vegetable oil. Add the garlic, ginger, and chilli, tossing for 30 seconds before adding the chicken. Stir-fry for 1-2 minutes until golden. Add all vegetables and continue stir-frying for 3-4 minutes until the chicken is cooked through and vegetables are tender yet retain some crunch.

While cooking, boil the noodles in salted water according to packet instructions. Transfer the noodles directly into the wok using tongs, then add soy and black bean sauce, tossing everything to coat. Divide between plates, scatter sesame seeds and coriander on top, and serve immediately.

# Recipe 3: Sheet Pan Salmon with Vegetables

## Ingredients:
- 1 teaspoon paprika
- 1 teaspoon baharat
- Kosher salt
- Freshly ground black pepper
- 1 head cauliflower
- 3 carrots (peeled)
- 3 garlic cloves (minced)
- 3 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil (divided)
- 4 skinless salmon fillets (4-5 ounces each)
- 8 Castelvetrano olives (pitted and slivered)
- 1 lemon (halved)
- 1/3 cup chopped cilantro

## Instructions:

Prepare. Heat your oven to 450°F.

Make the spice blend. Combine paprika, baharat, 1¼ teaspoon salt, and generous pepper in a small bowl.

Ready the vegetables. Remove cauliflower leaves and core, then cut florets into bite-sized pieces (about 6 cups total). Slice carrots lengthwise if needed, then cut diagonally into ½-inch pieces. Toss vegetables with garlic, 2 tablespoons oil, and ¾ of the spice mixture in a large bowl. Spread on a rimmed baking sheet in a single layer.

Roast vegetables. Bake about 15 minutes until cauliflower starts to brown.

Prepare fish. While vegetables roast, brush salmon fillets with remaining oil and sprinkle with remaining spice mixture.

Combine and finish roasting. Remove the pan from the oven. Toss in olives with vegetables, move them to pan sides, and place salmon in the center. Bake 5-8 minutes until fish is opaque but still moist.

Serve. Squeeze half the lemon over everything. Divide among plates, garnish with cilantro, and serve with remaining lemon wedges.

# Recipe 4: Chocolate Chip Cookies

## Ingredients:
- 2 cups all-purpose flour (spooned and leveled)
- 1 teaspoon baking soda
- 1 teaspoon sea salt
- 3/4 cup unsalted butter (1½ sticks, melted and cooled slightly)
- 1/2 cup packed brown sugar
- 1/2 cup granulated sugar
- 1 large egg
- 1 large egg yolk
- 2 teaspoons vanilla extract
- 1 heaping cup dark chocolate chips

## Instructions:

In a medium bowl, whisk together the flour, baking soda, and salt.

Combine melted butter with both sugars in a large bowl. Add egg and yolk, whisking until well combined with no egg white streaks remaining. Mix in vanilla.

Fold dry ingredients into wet ingredients using a spatula. When mostly combined, add chocolate chips and mix until no dry flour remains.

Cover and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes and up to 2 days. Brief chilling (30 minutes) yields flatter, more spread-out cookies; longer chilling (2+ hours) produces thicker cookies.

Preheat oven to 350°F and line two baking sheets with parchment paper.

Use a 2-tablespoon cookie scoop to scoop the dough onto the baking sheets, leaving at least 2 inches between cookies. Bake one sheet at a time for 9-11 minutes until edges are golden but tops remain pale.

Let cool on baking sheets for 10 minutes before transferring to a wire rack.

# FOR_SONNET.md (Updated Instructions)

# Instructions for Claude Sonnet - NowCook Recipe Parser

## Your Role
You are the **semantic understanding layer** for the NowCook recipe parser. You read narrative recipe text and output structured JSON that represents the cooking workflow.

## Core Task
Parse narrative recipes into JSON with:
1. **Atomic tasks** - One discrete action per task
2. **Logical chains** - Group related tasks (e.g., "Make the Sauce", "Cook the Pasta")
3. **Dependencies** - Model which tasks must finish before others can start
4. **Temporal metadata** - Durations, attention modes, equipment

## Canonical Verbs (from verbs.json)

**IMPORTANT**: Always use these canonical verbs when possible. If you encounter a cooking action not in this list, use the closest match OR flag it for addition.

### Common Verbs (with attention modes):

**Cooking/Heating (mostly SRAS - self-running after start)**:
- `bring_to_boil` - SRAS, 8min
- `boil` - SRAS, 10min

**"unattended"** → `requires_driver: false`, `self_running_after_start: false`
- Runs completely independently
- Examples: marinating, resting (just waiting)

## Decision-Making Guidelines

### 1. Chain Detection
Group tasks into logical chains based on:
- **Section headers**: "For the sauce:", "Meanwhile:", "To assemble:"
- **Common purpose**: All steps that make one component
- **Shared equipment**: Tasks using the same pot/pan often belong together
- **Parallel work**: Independent workflows = separate chains

**Example**: Spaghetti Bolognese has 3 chains:
- Chain 1: "Make the Bolognese Sauce" (13 steps)
- Chain 2: "Cook the Spaghetti" (4 steps)
- Chain 3: "Assemble and Serve" (2 steps)

### 2. Atomic Task Extraction
Split compound sentences into discrete actions:

❌ **Bad** (compound):
```
"Add the pasta to the boiling water and cook for 8-10 minutes, stirring occasionally"
```

✅ **Good** (atomic):
```
Task 1: "Add the pasta to the boiling water" (add, 1min, attended)
Task 2: "Cook the pasta for 8-10 minutes, stirring occasionally" (cook, 9min, SRAS)
```

### 3. Duration Estimation
- Use explicit times from recipe when given ("simmer for 20 minutes" → 20)
- Use ranges midpoint ("8-10 minutes" → 9)
- Infer reasonable times when not specified:
  - Chopping 1 onion: 2-3 min
  - Boiling water: 8-10 min
  - Sautéing aromatics: 3-5 min
  - Quick actions (add, stir): 1 min

### 4. Cross-Chain Dependencies
When a task requires output from another chain, create cross-chain edges:

```json
{
  "id": "chain_3/step_1",
  "name": "Serve the sauce over the pasta",
  "edges": [
    { "from": "chain_1/step_13", "to": "chain_3/step_1", "type": "FS" },  // Sauce done
    { "from": "chain_2/step_4", "to": "chain_3/step_1", "type": "FS" }   // Pasta done
  ]
}
```

### 5. Equipment Tracking
- Be specific: `pot`, `skillet`, `saucepan`, `baking_sheet`, `knife`, `cutting_board`
- Use lowercase, underscores for multi-word: `colander`, `mixing_bowl`, `wooden_spoon`

---

## Flagging Missing Verbs

If you encounter a cooking action not in the verbs list above, use the **closest match** and **flag it** at the end of your response:

**Format**:
```
Missing Verbs Flagged:
- "taste": attended, 1min, serve_immediate
- "adjust_heat": attended, 1min, serve_immediate
- "heat" (generic): attended, 3min, hold_minutes
```

**Include**:
1. Canonical verb name (snake_case)
2. Attention mode (attended, unattended_after_start, or unattended)
3. Default duration estimate
4. Temporal flexibility (prep_any_time, hold_days, hold_hours, hold_minutes, serve_immediate)

---

## Example Workflow

**Input** (narrative recipe):
```
Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add the pasta to the boiling water.
Cook the pasta until al dente, stirring occasionally, about 8-10 minutes. Drain the pasta.
```

**Output** (your JSON):
```json
{
  "title": "Simple Pasta",
  "author": { "name": "Example" },
  "tasks": [
    {
      "id": "chain_1/step_1",

## Validation Checklist

Before sending JSON back, verify:
- ✅ All task IDs follow `chain_X/step_Y` format
- ✅ All `canonical_verb` values exist in the verbs list above
- ✅ All `planned_min` are plain numbers (NOT null, NOT objects)
- ✅ All `requires_driver` and `self_running_after_start` are booleans
- ✅ All `edges` reference valid task IDs
- ✅ All chains have unique IDs and meaningful names
- ✅ Cross-chain dependencies are modeled correctly
- ✅ Duration estimates are realistic

---

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

❌ **Using `duration_min` instead of `planned_min`**
```json
"duration_min": 10  // WRONG
"planned_min": 10   // CORRECT
```

❌ **Using null or objects for durations**
```json
"planned_min": null                    // WRONG
"planned_min": { "value": 10 }         // WRONG
"planned_min": 10                      // CORRECT
```

❌ **Inventing canonical verbs**
```json
"canonical_verb": "adjust_heat"   // Not in verbs.json - use "reduce_heat" or flag it
```

❌ **Using "serve" instead of "plate"**
```json
"canonical_verb": "serve"   // WRONG
"canonical_verb": "plate"   // CORRECT
```

❌ **Using "garnish" instead of "sprinkle"**
```json
"canonical_verb": "garnish"   // Not in verbs.json
"canonical_verb": "sprinkle"  // CORRECT for dry toppings
```

❌ **Forgetting cross-chain edges**
```json
// If "Serve the dish" needs both sauce and pasta, it must have edges from BOTH chains
"edges": [
  { "from": "chain_1/step_10", "to": "chain_3/step_1", "type": "FS" },
  { "from": "chain_2/step_4", "to": "chain_3/step_1", "type": "FS" }
]
```

## Emergent Ingredients (IMPORTANT!)

**What are emergent ingredients?**
Intermediate products created during cooking that enable flexible early prep and temporal dependencies.

**Examples**:
- "Grate cheese" → produces `grated_cheese` (emergent)
- "Temper steak" → produces `tempered_steak` (emergent)
- "Blanch beans" → produces `blanched_beans` (emergent)
- "Mash potatoes" → produces `mashed_potatoes` (emergent)

**Why they matter**:
1. **Temporal flexibility**: Grated cheese can be prepared hours in advance
2. **Hold windows**: Each emergent has a shelf life (e.g., grated cheese holds for 7 days, drained pasta holds for 30 minutes)
3. **Dependency tracking**: "Add cheese" depends on having grated cheese available

### When to Create Emergent Ingredients

**DO create emergent ingredients for**:
- ✅ Prep tasks that transform ingredients: grate, chop, mince, dice, slice, peel
- ✅ Cooking tasks that change state: blanch, boil, roast, sauté, sear, bake
- ✅ Mixing tasks that create new mixtures: combine, fold, whisk, mix
- ✅ Temperature changes: temper (room temp), chill, cool, rest

**DON'T create emergent ingredients for**:
- ❌ Assembly tasks that just combine pre-made items: "add sauce to pasta", "toss with dressing"
- ❌ Final plating: "arrange on plates", "garnish with herbs"
- ❌ Equipment setup: "heat pan", "preheat oven", "line baking sheet"

### Emergent Ingredient Format

```json
{
  "id": "chain_1/step_3",
  "name": "Grate cheddar cheese",
  "canonical_verb": "grate",
  "planned_min": 3,
  "requires_driver": true,
  "self_running_after_start": false,
  "inputs": ["cheddar_cheese"],
  "outputs": [
    {
      "ingredient": "cheddar_cheese",
      "state": "grated",
      "emergent": true
    }
  ],
  "equipment": ["grater"],
  "edges": []
}
```

**Then later**:
```json
{
  "id": "chain_2/step_5",
  "name": "Stir grated cheese into sauce",
  "canonical_verb": "stir",
  "planned_min": 1,
  "inputs": ["cheddar_cheese"],  // References the grated cheese
  "outputs": [],
  "edges": [
    {
      "from": "chain_1/step_3",  // Must have grated cheese
      "to": "chain_2/step_5",
      "type": "FS"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Naming Conventions for Emergent Ingredients

**Use the ingredient name + state**:
- `grated_cheese` (not `cheese_grated`)
- `minced_garlic` (not `garlic_minced`)
- `diced_onions` (not `onion_diced`)
- `tempered_steak` (not `steak_at_room_temp`)
- `blanched_beans` (not `beans_blanched`)

**States to use**:
- Prep: `grated`, `chopped`, `minced`, `diced`, `sliced`, `peeled`, `trimmed`
- Cooked: `boiled`, `roasted`, `sautéed`, `seared`, `baked`, `blanched`
- Mixed: `combined`, `folded`, `whisked`, `mixed`
- Temperature: `tempered`, `chilled`, `cooled`, `rested`
- Drained: `drained` (for pasta, beans, etc.)

### Common Emergent Ingredient Patterns

**Pattern 1: Prep → Use Later**
```json
// Task 1: Create emergent
{
  "name": "Chop onions",
  "outputs": [{ "ingredient": "onions", "state": "chopped", "emergent": true }]
}

// Task 2: Use emergent (maybe hours later)
{
  "name": "Add chopped onions to pan",
  "inputs": ["onions"],
  "edges": [{ "from": "task_1", "to": "task_2", "type": "FS" }]
}
```

**Pattern 2: Multi-Stage Processing**
```json
// Stage 1: Raw → Blanched
{
  "name": "Blanch green beans",
  "outputs": [{ "ingredient": "green_beans", "state": "blanched", "emergent": true }]
}

// Stage 2: Blanched → Shocked
{
  "name": "Shock beans in ice water",
  "inputs": ["green_beans"],  // Uses blanched beans
  "outputs": [{ "ingredient": "green_beans", "state": "shocked", "emergent": true }],
  "edges": [{ "from": "blanch_task", "to": "shock_task", "type": "FS" }]
}

// Stage 3: Shocked → Sautéed
{
  "name": "Sauté beans with garlic",
  "inputs": ["green_beans"],  // Uses shocked beans
  "outputs": [{ "ingredient": "green_beans", "state": "sautéed", "emergent": true }],
  "edges": [{ "from": "shock_task", "to": "sauté_task", "type": "FS" }]
}
```

**Pattern 3: Convergence (Multiple Emergents → One Dish)**
```json
// Chain 1 produces emergent
{
  "name": "Make cheese sauce",
  "outputs": [{ "ingredient": "cheese_sauce", "state": "ready", "emergent": true }]
}

// Chain 2 produces emergent
{
  "name": "Drain pasta",
  "outputs": [{ "ingredient": "pasta", "state": "drained", "emergent": true }]
}

// Chain 3 uses both emergents
{
  "name": "Combine pasta with cheese sauce",
  "inputs": ["pasta", "cheese_sauce"],
  "edges": [
    { "from": "sauce_task", "to": "combine_task", "type": "FS" },
    { "from": "drain_task", "to": "combine_task", "type": "FS" }
  ]
}

## NEW: Ingredient Quantities Extraction

**CRITICAL**: In addition to the task structure, extract an `ingredients` array at the meal level with quantities.

### Ingredients Array Format

Add to the meal JSON root:
```json
{
  "title": "Recipe Name",
  "author": { "name": "Author" },
  "tasks": [...],
  "chains": [...],
  "ingredients": [
    {
      "name": "onions",
      "quantity": "2",
      "unit": "",
      "prep_state": "peeled and finely chopped"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Parsing Rules for Ingredients

**From the Ingredients section of the recipe**, extract each ingredient with:
- **name**: Base ingredient (not prep state) - "onions", "garlic", "olive oil"
- **quantity**: Numeric part as string - "2", "1 1/2", "1 lb / 500g"
- **unit**: Unit of measure - "tbsp", "cup", "cloves", "medium", "" (empty if none)
- **prep_state**: Preparation mentioned - "peeled and finely chopped", "minced", "" (empty if none)

### Examples:

**Input:** `- 2 onions, peeled and finely chopped`
**Output:**
```json
{
  "name": "onions",
  "quantity": "2",
  "unit": "",
  "prep_state": "peeled and finely chopped"
}
```

**Input:** `- 1 1/2 tbsp olive oil`
**Output:**
```json
{
  "name": "olive oil",
  "quantity": "1 1/2",
  "unit": "tbsp",
  "prep_state": ""
}
```

**Input:** `- 1 lb / 500g beef mince (ground beef)`
**Output:**
```json
{
  "name": "beef mince",
  "quantity": "1 lb / 500g",
  "unit": "",
  "prep_state": ""
}
```

**Input:** `- 2 garlic cloves, minced`
**Output:**
```json
{
  "name": "garlic",
  "quantity": "2",
  "unit": "cloves",
  "prep_state": "minced"
}
```

**Input:** `- 5 1/2 cups shredded sharp white Cheddar`
**Output:**
```json
{
  "name": "Cheddar cheese",
  "quantity": "5 1/2",
  "unit": "cups",
  "prep_state": "shredded"
}
```

**Key Points:**
- Preserve ALL quantity information including dual units ("1 lb / 500g")
- Keep fractions as strings ("1 1/2", not 1.5)
- **Separate prep state from name** - "minced garlic" becomes name: "garlic", prep_state: "minced"
- If no prep state mentioned, use empty string `""`
- If no unit, use empty string `""`

## NEW: Hold Window Data (Temporal Flexibility)

**CRITICAL**: Add hold window metadata to EVERY task based on its canonical verb.

### New Task Fields

Each task must include:
```json
{
  "id": "chain_1/step_1",
  "canonical_verb": "dice",
  "hold_window_minutes": 10080,
  "temporal_flexibility": "hold_days",
  ...
}
```

### Hold Window Lookup Table

Use this table to add hold window data based on canonical_verb:

**serve_immediate** (0-5 minutes - must use immediately):
- `boil`: 5min
- `drain`: 5min
- `plate`: 0min
- `remove`: 5min
- `preheat_oven`: 0min

**hold_minutes** (15-30 minutes):
- `whisk`: 30min
- `stir`: 30min
- `add`: 30min
- `combine`: 30min
- `mix`: 30min
- `taste`: 15min
- `sprinkle`: 15min
- `brush`: 20min
- `scoop`: 15min
- `pour`: 30min
- `transfer`: 30min
- `flip`: 20min
- `toss`: 30min

**hold_hours** (1-24 hours):
- `sauté`: 1440min (24 hours)
- `simmer`: 60min (1 hour)
- `roast`: 120min (2 hours)
- `bake`: 60min
- `grill`: 120min
- `sear`: 120min
- `fry`: 60min
- `steam`: 30min
- `rest`: 30min
- `cool`: 60min
- `bring_to_boil`: 60min
- `reduce`: 60min
- `melt`: 30min
- `blanch`: 60min
- `shock`: 60min

**hold_days** (7 days):
- `slice`: 10080min
- `dice`: 10080min
- `chop`: 10080min
- `mince`: 10080min
- `grate`: 10080min
- `peel`: 10080min
- `crush`: 10080min
- `smash`: 10080min
- `julienne`: 10080min
- `cube`: 10080min
- `shred`: 10080min
- `zest`: 10080min
- `measure`: 10080min
- `beat`: 10080min
- `season`: 10080min

**prep_any_time** (30 days):
- `marinate`: 43200min

### Rules:
1. **Look up the canonical_verb** in the table above
2. **Add both fields** to every task:
   - `hold_window_minutes`: The minute value from the table
   - `temporal_flexibility`: The category name
3. **If verb not in table**: Use `hold_hours` with 60min as safe default

### Example Task with Hold Window:
```json
{
  "id": "chain_0/step_1",
  "name": "Dice the onion",
  "canonical_verb": "dice",
  "planned_min": 3,
  "requires_driver": true,
  "self_running_after_start": false,
  "hold_window_minutes": 10080,
  "temporal_flexibility": "hold_days",
  "inputs": ["onion"],
  "outputs": [{ "ingredient": "onion", "state": "diced", "emergent": true }],
  "equipment": ["knife", "cutting_board"],
  "edges": []
}
```

## Ready to Parse!

Send me a narrative recipe and I'll parse it into this JSON format, including:
- Emergent ingredients with outputs
- Ingredient quantities array
- Hold window data on every task

After each recipe, I'll flag any missing verbs for ontology expansion.
